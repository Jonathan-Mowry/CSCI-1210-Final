                I was born on April 12th 2002 in Kingsport, Tennessee. I grew up in Rogersville, a small town in North East Tennessee. I attended the local schools all the way through high school until I graduated May 2020 from Cherokee High School. After finishing high school I started attending East Tennessee State University the following fall semester. I'm currently working towards a major in Studio Art, and after completing my Bachelors, I'm looking to attend a Masters program for Expressive Art Therapy. I paint and draw in my free time and I try to cover many different forms of art. I also try to include a wide variety of styles including cartoons, animals, and other areas. One day I hope my art can inspire others to help them create their own pieces of art.
