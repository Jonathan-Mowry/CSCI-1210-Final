            My mission is to help spread my own creativity to inspire others to create. I truly enjoy making pieces of art and I hope to continue doing this through the commissions I receive. To help support the works of local artists, I'm donating 5% of all profits from commissions to local Art organizations in East Tennessee. My hope is that these funds can help these organizations reach out to more people and help them interact with artists. The main foundation I will be donating to is the <a href="https://www.rogersvilleartscouncil.org/">Rogersville Art Council</a>. It is truly a blessing to be able to help those around me and help them realize their artistic abilities.
